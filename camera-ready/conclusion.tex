\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We study automatic geo-localization of online event videos, which is the key component supporting various event analysis tasks such as cross camera tracking and 3d reconstruction. 
The major challenge lies in large appearance change of the environment due to human activity during the event. 
To solve this problem, we formulate the problem as region based joint saliency estimation and matching, and propose a solution, which iteratively estimates saliency and optimizes region based matching model.  
For the step of saliency optimization, we derived a closed form solution, which has an intuitive explanation. 
For region based matching model optimization, we apply self-paced learning algorithm to learn from the pseudo labels generated by saliency value estimated by matching. 
We conduct experiments on Boston Marathon 2013 dataset and Tokyo Time Machine datas	et to test the performance of our model. 
The experiments have shown that our solution significantly improves over matching on whole image and the automatically learned saliency has a strong correlation with manual labels on region saliency, proving that our model has significant application value. 
In the future, we will try more sophisticated CNN based models such as Resnet and NetVLAD in our matching model to improve performance.  
% As the cost of manually labeling all the exact matching point or region is unaffordable, weak labels are common situation in matching problems. 
% We will generalize this problem formulation to matching problems in different tasks at different levels: interest points and regions. 
% We also hope to design a framework based on current solution for a generalized problem formulation.
